Instructions for FontForge scripts as of SUN version 7.7
27 jun 2020

These scripts are written in python using the python version 3.8 imbedded in FontForge.

They were written on a windows PC but they should work on Linux, I would guess there may be some changes on directory and file handling.

Objective:
	Generate backfonts and documentation for the different versions of SUN.

Requirements:
    • FontForge 2020-03-14:  https://fontforge.org/en-US/
	Fontforge python documentation https://fontforge.org/python.html
    • potrace:  potrace is part of fontforge.
    • Imagemagick:  https://imagemagick.org/index.php
    • For creating spreadsheets in ods format install xlswriter:
	Instructions for installing xlswriter:
        ◦ open command prompt as admin
        ◦ cd to fontforgebuilds dir
        ◦ execute fontforge-console
        ◦ execute ffpython -m pip install --upgrade pip --force-reinstall
        ◦ execute pip install xlsxwriter
          
    • (not implemented yet) For creating pdf files with the fonts created by Fontforge, then the font needs to be loaded into the workdirectory.   Fontloader has a cli version that loads fonts temporally into windows.  It can be downloaded here Fontloader download.
          	
    • Change terminal codepage to UTF-8

        ◦ from Windows 10 run → intl.cpl
        ◦ Adminstrative Tab
        ◦ Change system locale
        ◦ Check Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for world wide language support
        ◦ Select OK
        ◦ Restart 
        ◦ Note: if this procedure is not acceptable read the above webpage for options

Product::

    • English primary dictionary from sfd  – pw(Ver)_EN.ods
    • Backfont from primary dictionary		
    • English dictionary from kmn file 
    • Language backfont and dictionary from primary words
    • kmn from dictionary
    • All language primary merged from Language dictionary and English primary
    • Language dictionaries sorted by name or language name.
      
Problems found with Language dictionaries:
    • Missing words:  The language dictionary may not be up to date with the current English dictionary.  The language field will be left blank
    • Duplicate words in language dictionaries different unicodes.  These are language words which translate the same from different English words.  The first word in the list will be used.  The field will be blank for the second word since Sun can’t use the same name for different unicodes.
    • Unicodes with o instead of 0.  These have to be manually fixed.
    • Unicode miscompares with down level dictionaries.  The unicode from the Enflish primary list will be used.
    • Words with spaces.  The spaces are replaced with  '_' (underscore)

Setup:  
Install Fontforge and Imagemagick per default.
Create a work directory containing all the python scripts and config files.
From the work directory create Log, Dist, Input and Svg directories
	The Log directory keeps all the log files of the code run
	The Dist directory keeps the files for distribution.  A complete run will create a zip  	file containing the files to be distributed.
	Place all files used for input in the Input directory.  i.e.  sfd, kmn, dictionary, 			times.ttf.
	The Svg directory contains the svg images for the backfont file.

Running Scripts:
Open a Command Prompt window and change to the directory where your code is.
A basic FontForge command is.
	fontforge  -script pythonscript.py ...params….
Most of the function names should be self explanatory, however some variable  names may not be quite so obvious.

The order of running the scripts is important.  They should be executed in the 
following order:
	kmn2csv, sfd2csv, csv2svg – other files in any order.. bfZip last
	For language files:  kmn2csv and sfd2csv must have been run in English first
		langpri, csv2kmn csv2svg – other files in any order… bfZip last

You can always contact me for an explanation of the code.

BackFont Procedures:
	The requirements to generate scripts
		The FontForge – xxxx.sfd file provided by Ernie.
		The Keyman – xxx.kmn file provided by Ernie.
		Times.ttf – The font file used for generating the backfont images.  This can be 				extracted from the window pc

	If another language is to be created:
A dictionary containing the English and language equivalent columns along with 
the uni-codes and symbols columns needs to be copied to the Input directory
along with the English Primary dictionary.  
The version should be set to the same version as the English primary dictionary
to get file naming convention right.

	The order of the columns of the dictionary is important.  I no longer try to figure out the
		the order.  The order for english  is:  symbol, name, unicode, reference.
	
		If it is another language the order is: symbol, englishname, languagename, 			unicode, reference

	The sfd file contains the symbols and unicodes for the primary words and is used to 		generate the list of primary words
	
	The kmn file contains the primary words and the synonyms of primary words along with  	their unicodes.
	
Scripts:
	doall.bat – This is a batch file executing all the scripts. 
		Execution doall.bat parms
			parms is either “doall” or the name of the python script without the 					extention.
		i.e. doall all
		i.e. doall sfd2csv
	
		Look at this file to see how commands are executed.

		The doall.bat file uses the environment variables from doEnv.bat
set sfd=sun7_7_519.sfd
set kmn=sun7_7_519.kmn
set ver=77
set ttffont=times.ttf
set alias=EN
set langIn=sun.eng.to.rus.feb20.ods
set langOut=SUNBF77_EN.sfd
		
This batch file will generate all files and documents into a complete package.
		It can also by,  passing the python file name execute only that one file.
		
	bfdoall.bat – This is a GUI program for setting up the variables in doEnv.bat.  Easier 			than typing in an editor.

	config.json – This contains variables and lists  for each language and may 				eventually be rewritten as more languages are built.

	bfConfig.py – updates and reads the config.json file.

	util.py – contains some common functions used in all the code

	bflogger.py – sets up the logging.
			Three log files are generated with each run.
			Filename.dbg – contains logging at the DEBUG level.
			Filename.log – contains logging at the INFO level.
			Filename.err – contains logging at the ERROR level.
		Looking at these files will give a status of the run.

	array2xlsx.py – This script will generate xlsx files from arrays which are then 			converted to ods files.  This script program automatically resizes the spreadsheet 	columns formats to make into a pdf 	

	The following files are the work files.  They are being tweaked as languages come 			in spreadsheet problems are found.  I expect these to become more stable as 			we solve more issues.
		The doall.bat file shows how the commands are executed.  Some scripts also 			print out the syntax of the parameters.

sfd2csv.py – This script takes the sfd file and generates  pw%ver%_%alias%.csv  file 	containing a list of	primary words.  This csv file is used in most of the other 	scripts.

kmn2csv.py – This script takes the keyman kmn  file and generates  kmnSUN%ver	%_%alias%.csv  file which contains he complete dictionary.

langpri.py – This script takes pw%ver%_%alias%.csv and the “language.csv” file to 	generatelpw%ver%_%alias%.csv.

csv2kmn.py – This scripts takes the language primary words file and creates a kmn 	file.  This will work on any sun dictionary file to create a kmn file.

csv2svg.py – Takes the pw%ver%_%alias%.csv file and generates an image of each 	word as a svg file.

svg2Font.py – Uses the svg files from the previous script to import into the	 	backfont sfd 	file.  It also creates a ttf and woff file.

AT this point the generated ttf file needs to be installed in the PC if PDF files are created.
On windows right clicking on the file should give an option to install it.

The following scripts generate documents and spreadsheets for the version of SUN

back2doc.py – This creates a text file for the purpose of verifying the quality of the 	backfont.  Glancing through the file will show anomalies to be corrected. Either 	missing or overlayed or out of alignment words.


compact4x16.py – This generates compact%ver%_%lang%.ods and compact%ver	%_%alias%.pdf  which gives a 4 column list of the glyphs on a page. 

bfZip.py – Packages the distribution files  into a zip file.

bfdoall.py – This is a dialog for easily setting up the doEnv.bat file for use by the 	doall.bat file.  Optionally it will run any or all the scripts.

bfmain.py – This can replace the doall.bat file for manual running.  It makes 	debugging and viewing of run results in a friendlier manner than the text files.
	It will modify the doEnv.bat and config.json files.  This is executed by calling 	bf.bat
